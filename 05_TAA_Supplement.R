## 4.2 Grouped Data and the "Group" Aesthetic

# Reminder of what gapminder looks like
view(gapminder)

# Brief reminder of what we looked at in chapter 3

p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp))
p

# We plotted a scatterplot of y against x
p + geom_point() 

# Then we added a smoothed line of y against x

p + geom_smooth()

# Then we combined both the scatterplot and the smoother line

p + geom_point() + geom_smooth() 

# In section 4.2, let's try the same thing, but with different variables


p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = year,
                          y = gdpPercap))
p + geom_line()       

# To see what's going on, take a look at structure of data

str(gapminder)

# We are asking it to plot a Factor variable on a continuous axis

# Let's plot continuous variable against continuous variable, but grouped by Factors

p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = year,
                          y = gdpPercap))
p + geom_line(mapping = 
                    aes(group = country))       

## 4.3 Facet to Make Small Multiples
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = year,
                          y = gdpPercap))

p + geom_line(mapping = aes(group = country)) + 
    facet_wrap(~ continent)      

# Note how the layout of the picture allows facets to share axes titles

# Also note that "~ continent" is a powerful statement. For now, DON'T use it
# on continuous variables, and be careful about using it Factors with a lot of levels.

p + geom_line(mapping = aes(group = country)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ country)      

# FIne-tuning facet_wrap() to specify 5 columns

p + geom_line(mapping = aes(group = country)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ continent, ncol = 5)      

# Let's add a smoothing line, set color for each country to grey, 
# use log10 y-axis, and add labels

p + geom_line(color="gray70", mapping=aes(group = country)) +
    geom_smooth(size = 1.1, method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
    scale_y_log10(labels=scales::dollar) +
    facet_wrap(~ continent, ncol = 5) +
    labs(x = "Year",
         y = "log GDP per capita",
         title = "GDP per capita on Five Continents")      

# Why did we specify "se = FALSE"?

# Healy switches to GSS data. Let's look at it:

View(gss_sm)

# Using the gss_sm data set to show faceting by two Factors at the same time

p <- ggplot(data = gss_sm, mapping = aes(x = age, y = childs))
p + geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + 
    geom_smooth() +
    facet_grid(sex ~ race)

# Let's look at another example of the usefulness of faceting

# Following data is in your repo, and is from https://ourworldindata.org/policy-responses-covid

owid_covid_data <- read_csv("owid-covid-data.csv")

# The above will generate some warnings, which we will ignore for now 

# Let's look at the data

View(owid_covid_data)

# Handy built-in function for categorizing variables is cut()
owid_covid_data$s_bucket <- cut(owid_covid_data$stringency_index,
                                c(-10,0,10, 20, 30 ,40,50,60,70,80,90,100))

# How many observations in each bucket?
